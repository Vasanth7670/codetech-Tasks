This Java program is a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. The user is prompted to input two numbers and then select an operation to perform on these numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Based on the user's choice, the program executes the operation and displays the result.

Features:

Prompts user for two numerical inputs.
Offers a menu of operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Prevents division by zero, displaying an error message if the user tries to divide by zero.
Uses a switch statement to execute the selected operation.
Usage:

Run the program in a Java-supporting environment.
Enter two numbers when prompted.
Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1-4).
The result of the operation will be displayed on the console.
This program is intended for practice with Java fundamentals, including Scanner input, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic. It can be further expanded by adding more operations or enhanced error handling.
